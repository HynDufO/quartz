Convolutional Neural Networks, commonly referred to as CNNs are a specialized type of neural network designed to process and classify **images**.
## Convolutional layers
- **Convolutional Layers**
	- These layers are fundamental in CNNs.
	- They perform the critical operation of convolution.
- **Kernels**
	- Specialized filters that traverse the input image.
	- Extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
	- Represented as small matrices of numbers.

- **Kernel Operation**
	- Involves element-wise multiplication with the image pixels.
	- Various methods for deciding kernel values based on desired effects.

- **Convolution Operation**
	- Multiplying kernel values by original pixel values and summing results.
- **Feature Map**
	- Output matrix generated by the convolution process.
- **Utility and Importance**
	- Convolution allows automatic extraction of image features.
	- Enables CNNs to learn hierarchical representations of visual patterns.
### Channels
**Key Points: Channels in Convolutional Layers**

1. **Representation of Features**: Channels in convolutional layers represent distinct aspects or features of the input image.

2. **Output of Kernels**: Each channel is produced by applying multiple kernels to the input image, where each kernel detects specific patterns or features.
   
3. **Feature Maps**: The output of each kernel is a feature map, and collectively, these maps form the channels in the convolutional layer.
   
4. **Distinct Features**: Different channels may correspond to different characteristics such as edges, textures, or colors, depending on the learned patterns by the kernels.
   
5. **Hierarchical Representation**: Channels enable the extraction of various features from the input image, contributing to the network's ability to learn hierarchical representations.
